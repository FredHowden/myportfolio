            <div>
                I live in the Netherlands
                I&apos;m a student at Media college Amsterdam.
                I enjoy problem solving.
                I started my first official project in 2021 and tried making a program
                that beat the stock market.
                I didn&apos;t, but since then I&apos;ve succeeded in creating other projects, but currently
                I&apos;m creating a browser extension that automatically replaces all images on a website with versions of the same images,
                but with the text in each image translated into the user&apos;s preferred language.
            </div>
        </section>
