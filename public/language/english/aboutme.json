I enjoy problem-solving and began my first official project in 2021, attempting to create a program that could beat the stock market. While that project failed, it still sparked my interest in programming, and since then I've completed several other projects. At the moment, I'm working on a browser extension that automatically replaces all images on a website with versions in which the text is translated into the user's preferred language."
